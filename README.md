# Verilog Basics – Learning and Project Repository

This repository documents my progress as I learn and apply Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language) as part of my broader six-month self-directed learning plan focused on digital logic design, embedded systems, and FPGA development.

## About This Repository

This repo contains beginner-to-intermediate Verilog projects designed to help me develop core skills in:

- Combinational and sequential logic design
- Simulation and testbench writing
- Structural vs behavioral modeling
- Arithmetic logic, control signals, and clock manipulation

These projects were completed alongside the [LinkedIn Learning course: Learning Verilog for FPGA Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-verilog-for-fpga-development/) taught by Eduardo Corpeño.

The goal of this work is to build fluency in writing, simulating, and debugging Verilog modules, preparing me for FPGA-based prototyping, embedded systems roles, and future coursework or internships in digital hardware design.

## Projects Included

Each project has its own folder with:
- Verilog design module(s)
- A testbench for simulation
- README with logic explanation, output, and learning highlights

### 1. Prime Number Checker
Implements logic to detect prime numbers from 3-bit binary input based on a schematic diagram.

### 2. Triple Testbench
Tests a module that multiplies a 4-bit number by 3. Demonstrates basic arithmetic and testbench use.

### 3. 4-bit ALU
Implements a simple arithmetic logic unit with support for addition, multiplication, modulus, and bitwise AND operations.

### 4. Clock Divider
Creates a configurable frequency divider that reduces an input clock signal by a user-defined ratio.

## Tools Used

- Verilog HDL
- EDA Playground (for online simulation)
- Vivado (Xilinx) for local development and waveform analysis
- ModelSim and Icarus Verilog (optional tools for future projects)

## Learning Goals

- Strengthen understanding of hardware logic design
- Practice test-driven HDL development with simulation
- Build foundational experience to support more advanced projects including FSMs, UART, and soft-core processors
- Prepare for internship roles focused on embedded systems, FPGA prototyping, or hardware-software integration

## What’s Next

I plan to continue building Verilog-based projects, including more advanced digital designs. These upcoming projects will be featured in separate repositories to keep this one focused on foundational learning.
